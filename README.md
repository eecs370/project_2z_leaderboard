=============
We are using [Primer Spec](https://github.com/eecs485staff/primer-spec) to generate specs out of markdown files.

All you need to do to update the specs is edit the markdown file and the config file will automatically generate the html.

To preview the specs locally, follow the [Primer Spec instructions for previewing locally](https://github.com/eecs485staff/primer-spec/blob/develop/docs/USAGE_ADVANCED.md#previewing-locally).
