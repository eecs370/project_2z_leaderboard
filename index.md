Project 2z Leaderboard!!! (Winter 2022)
==============================
Notes:
- Only submissions accepted by the autograder script are shown.
- If a student has multiple submissions, only their highest ranking (per-list) submission is shown.
- The final verdict may be determined by additional tests.
- The uniqnames in the table have not yet been checked for whether they follow the rules of the competition (i.e. not using pre-calculated values).
- It may take awhile for your latest submission to be reflected in the leaderboard. Note that you can see the total instructions executed for your program in the feedback from the autograder.
